            "desc": " Up to date: This is a classification of customer default risk established by the Bank of Spain in its Circular 4/04. It is defined as the balance of the debt instruments and contingent liabilities that do not meet the requirements to be classified in the following categories: substandard, doubtful due to counterparty arrears, doubtful for reasons other than counterparty arrears, or write-offs.Within this category, it will be necessary to identify the transactions that require special monitoring, which are understood to be those presenting weaknesses which, while not requiring higher coverage than those established for the standard risk transactions, make special monitoring by the entity advisable. The transactions that must be identified as under special monitoring will include, until their extinction, the following:- refinancing, refinanced or restructured transactions; - as well as those relating to customers declared to be in insolvency proceedings that have been reclassified from one of the doubtful loan categories as they met the requirements set forth therein; and- the transactions classified as standard of customers that have one or more transactions classified as doubtful due to counterparty arrears. Despite the foregoing, the refinancing, refinanced and restructured transactions will cease to be identified as under special monitoring when it has finished. This will occur after an exhaustive review of their equity and financial situation, where the holders will not foreseeably be in financial difficulty and, therefore, may meet the payment of the debt (principal and interest) of all their transactions at the entity in due time and form and, moreover, provided that they have settled the principal and interest payments accrued from the date on which the restructuring or refinancing transaction was arranged, where at least two years have elapsed since that date, where the principal of the transaction has been reduced by, at least, 20%, and where the customers have paid all the amounts (principal and interest) that were unpaid at the date of the restructuring or refinancing transaction.The Special Watch classification is a regulatory requirement and is a different concept to the Special Monitoring portfolios (see definition of FEVE contained in this document). Substandard Risk: This is a classification of customer default risk established by the Bank of Spain in its Circular 4/04. It is defined as the balance of the debt instruments and contingent liabilities that, while not meeting the criteria to be classified individually as doubtful or as write-offs, present weaknesses that may cause the entity to assume losses exceeding the coverage for impairment of the risks under special monitoring. This category includes: the transactions of customers forming part of groups in difficulties, for which overall losses are estimated that exceed those relating to the categories described in the foregoing points, and transactions not documented adequately.Furthermore, in accordance with the Corporate Policy for Debt Forbearance, the following would be classified as substandard:- Transactions classified as doubtful may be reclassified to substandard once three months of payment have elapsed (not including grace periods), provided that, during the period of the new payments of the transaction, all the amounts (principal and ordinary interest) that were unpaid at the date of forbearance are paid, and that there is reasonable certainty that the customer is able to meet the payments according to the repayment schedule.- If a grace period has been established, the forbearance will be reclassified as substandard risk, provided that it has not already been classified as doubtful risk. This classification must continue until three monthly payments (or equivalent) have been paid after the grace period has finished.- If a forbearance transaction becomes impaired, this will be regarded as sufficient cause to classify it as substandard risk:o Where, after the forbearance, a non-technical impairment situation arises, it will be classified as substandard risk, provided that this impairment denotes an overstatement of the estimated payment capacity on analysing the viability of the forbearance.o A situation may not be considered to be technically impaired where the customer continues in an impairment situation for more than 30 days or where the impaired amount is higher than a repayment amount.DNPA: DNPA meaning 'Doubtful, Not Pre-Action', is a subjective classification of the risks. In these cases, while the loan may only be in arrears or even current in payment, there are reasonable doubts as to whether the customer will make full payment of the capital and interest under the contractual terms. These customers are assessed on a case-by-case basis using the expert criteria of the analyst/manager, and are considered by a decision-making body (in accordance with the Credit Risk Management Policy Manual).Classification as DNPA affects all the customer's transactions Simple Default: This is the balance of transactions with amounts more than 90 days past due, unless they have been classified as written-off. Where there are stricter local criteria at certain Units, the more conservative criteria will be included for transactions in arrears.In the terminology of Bank of Spain Circular 4/04, this relates to 'Doubtful due to counterparty arrears', except that which is classified as Pre-Action Portfolio or Portfolio at Procedural Stage (see definition in this document). The sum of Simple Default and the positions in Pre-Action Portfolio and Portfolio at Procedural Stage is the total Doubtful Due to Counterparty Arrears (according to the Bank of Spain definition)Pre-Action: This category contains the positions of customers about whom there are sufficient doubts as to the possibility of repayment. This is normally the situation prior to initiating legal action.Procedural: In this situation, a court claim is made on the debt. The out-of-court process is managed with the customer by the Recovery Manager and/or through the lawyer representing us. The portfolio at procedural stage should also take into consideration customers in bankruptcy proceedings. This circumstance should not entail abandoning direct negotiations with the debtor. Therefore, the Portfolio at Procedural Stage will only include the balances of loans claimed using legal action that are not current in payment and that are non-performing. The other balances of transactions claimed using legal action that are current in payment will be included in the DNPA PortfolioWrite-offs: The balance of the customers written off or down according to the timetable (pursuant to the regulator's rules) or as a result of an internal decision where appropriate, which have been derecognised. Classification in this category does not imply that the entity will interrupt negotiations and legal actions to recover the amount owedTotal Portfolio: It will include all the transactions defined for each measure, regardless of their credit situation.",

            "desc": " Up to date: This is a classification of customer default risk established by the Bank of Spain in its Circular 4/04. It is defined as the balance of the debt instruments and contingent liabilities that do not meet the requirements to be classified in the following categories: substandard, doubtful due to counterparty arrears, doubtful for reasons other than counterparty arrears, or write-offs.Within this category, it will be necessary to identify the transactions that require special monitoring, which are understood to be those presenting weaknesses which, while not requiring higher coverage than those established for the standard risk transactions, make special monitoring by the entity advisable. The transactions that must be identified as under special monitoring will include, until their extinction, the following:- refinancing, refinanced or restructured transactions; - as well as those relating to customers declared to be in insolvency proceedings that have been reclassified from one of the doubtful loan categories as they met the requirements set forth therein; and- the transactions classified as standard of customers that have one or more transactions classified as doubtful due to counterparty arrears. Despite the foregoing, the refinancing, refinanced and restructured transactions will cease to be identified as under special monitoring when it has finished. This will occur after an exhaustive review of their equity and financial situation, where the holders will not foreseeably be in financial difficulty and, therefore, may meet the payment of the debt (principal and interest) of all their transactions at the entity in due time and form and, moreover, provided that they have settled the principal and interest payments accrued from the date on which the restructuring or refinancing transaction was arranged, where at least two years have elapsed since that date, where the principal of the transaction has been reduced by, at least, 20%, and where the customers have paid all the amounts (principal and interest) that were unpaid at the date of the restructuring or refinancing transaction.The Special Watch classification is a regulatory requirement and is a different concept to the Special Monitoring portfolios (see definition of FEVE contained in this document). Substandard Risk: This is a classification of customer default risk established by the Bank of Spain in its Circular 4/04. It is defined as the balance of the debt instruments and contingent liabilities that, while not meeting the criteria to be classified individually as doubtful or as write-offs, present weaknesses that may cause the entity to assume losses exceeding the coverage for impairment of the risks under special monitoring. This category includes: the transactions of customers forming part of groups in difficulties, for which overall losses are estimated that exceed those relating to the categories described in the foregoing points, and transactions not documented adequately.Furthermore, in accordance with the Corporate Policy for Debt Forbearance, the following would be classified as substandard:- Transactions classified as doubtful may be reclassified to substandard once three months of payment have elapsed (not including grace periods), provided that, during the period of the new payments of the transaction, all the amounts (principal and ordinary interest) that were unpaid at the date of forbearance are paid, and that there is reasonable certainty that the customer is able to meet the payments according to the repayment schedule.- If a grace period has been established, the forbearance will be reclassified as substandard risk, provided that it has not already been classified as doubtful risk. This classification must continue until three monthly payments (or equivalent) have been paid after the grace period has finished.- If a forbearance transaction becomes impaired, this will be regarded as sufficient cause to classify it as substandard risk:o Where, after the forbearance, a non-technical impairment situation arises, it will be classified as substandard risk, provided that this impairment denotes an overstatement of the estimated payment capacity on analysing the viability of the forbearance.o A situation may not be considered to be technically impaired where the customer continues in an impairment situation for more than 30 days or where the impaired amount is higher than a repayment amount.DNPA: DNPA meaning 'Doubtful, Not Pre-Action', is a subjective classification of the risks. In these cases, while the loan may only be in arrears or even current in payment, there are reasonable doubts as to whether the customer will make full payment of the capital and interest under the contractual terms. These customers are assessed on a case-by-case basis using the expert criteria of the analyst/manager, and are considered by a decision-making body (in accordance with the Credit Risk Management Policy Manual).Classification as DNPA affects all the customer's transactions Simple Default: This is the balance of transactions with amounts more than 90 days past due, unless they have been classified as written-off. Where there are stricter local criteria at certain Units, the more conservative criteria will be included for transactions in arrears.In the terminology of Bank of Spain Circular 4/04, this relates to 'Doubtful due to counterparty arrears', except that which is classified as Pre-Action Portfolio or Portfolio at Procedural Stage (see definition in this document). The sum of Simple Default and the positions in Pre-Action Portfolio and Portfolio at Procedural Stage is the total Doubtful Due to Counterparty Arrears (according to the Bank of Spain definition)Pre-Action: This category contains the positions of customers about whom there are sufficient doubts as to the possibility of repayment. This is normally the situation prior to initiating legal action.Procedural: In this situation, a court claim is made on the debt. The out-of-court process is managed with the customer by the Recovery Manager and/or through the lawyer representing us. The portfolio at procedural stage should also take into consideration customers in bankruptcy proceedings. This circumstance should not entail abandoning direct negotiations with the debtor. Therefore, the Portfolio at Procedural Stage will only include the balances of loans claimed using legal action that are not current in payment and that are non-performing. The other balances of transactions claimed using legal action that are current in payment will be included in the DNPA PortfolioWrite-offs: The balance of the customers written off or down according to the timetable (pursuant to the regulator's rules) or as a result of an internal decision where appropriate, which have been derecognised. Classification in this category does not imply that the entity will interrupt negotiations and legal actions to recover the amount owedTotal Portfolio: It will include all the transactions defined for each measure, regardless of their credit situation.",

            "desc": " Up to date: This is a classification of customer default risk established by the Bank of Spain in its Circular 4/04. It is defined as the balance of the debt instruments and contingent liabilities that do not meet the requirements to be classified in the following categories: substandard, doubtful due to counterparty arrears, doubtful for reasons other than counterparty arrears, or write-offs.Within this category, it will be necessary to identify the transactions that require special monitoring, which are understood to be those presenting weaknesses which, while not requiring higher coverage than those established for the standard risk transactions, make special monitoring by the entity advisable. The transactions that must be identified as under special monitoring will include, until their extinction, the following:- refinancing, refinanced or restructured transactions; - as well as those relating to customers declared to be in insolvency proceedings that have been reclassified from one of the doubtful loan categories as they met the requirements set forth therein; and- the transactions classified as standard of customers that have one or more transactions classified as doubtful due to counterparty arrears. Despite the foregoing, the refinancing, refinanced and restructured transactions will cease to be identified as under special monitoring when it has finished. This will occur after an exhaustive review of their equity and financial situation, where the holders will not foreseeably be in financial difficulty and, therefore, may meet the payment of the debt (principal and interest) of all their transactions at the entity in due time and form and, moreover, provided that they have settled the principal and interest payments accrued from the date on which the restructuring or refinancing transaction was arranged, where at least two years have elapsed since that date, where the principal of the transaction has been reduced by, at least, 20%, and where the customers have paid all the amounts (principal and interest) that were unpaid at the date of the restructuring or refinancing transaction.The Special Watch classification is a regulatory requirement and is a different concept to the Special Monitoring portfolios (see definition of FEVE contained in this document). Substandard Risk: This is a classification of customer default risk established by the Bank of Spain in its Circular 4/04. It is defined as the balance of the debt instruments and contingent liabilities that, while not meeting the criteria to be classified individually as doubtful or as write-offs, present weaknesses that may cause the entity to assume losses exceeding the coverage for impairment of the risks under special monitoring. This category includes: the transactions of customers forming part of groups in difficulties, for which overall losses are estimated that exceed those relating to the categories described in the foregoing points, and transactions not documented adequately.Furthermore, in accordance with the Corporate Policy for Debt Forbearance, the following would be classified as substandard:- Transactions classified as doubtful may be reclassified to substandard once three months of payment have elapsed (not including grace periods), provided that, during the period of the new payments of the transaction, all the amounts (principal and ordinary interest) that were unpaid at the date of forbearance are paid, and that there is reasonable certainty that the customer is able to meet the payments according to the repayment schedule.- If a grace period has been established, the forbearance will be reclassified as substandard risk, provided that it has not already been classified as doubtful risk. This classification must continue until three monthly payments (or equivalent) have been paid after the grace period has finished.- If a forbearance transaction becomes impaired, this will be regarded as sufficient cause to classify it as substandard risk:o Where, after the forbearance, a non-technical impairment situation arises, it will be classified as substandard risk, provided that this impairment denotes an overstatement of the estimated payment capacity on analysing the viability of the forbearance.o A situation may not be considered to be technically impaired where the customer continues in an impairment situation for more than 30 days or where the impaired amount is higher than a repayment amount.DNPA: DNPA meaning 'Doubtful, Not Pre-Action', is a subjective classification of the risks. In these cases, while the loan may only be in arrears or even current in payment, there are reasonable doubts as to whether the customer will make full payment of the capital and interest under the contractual terms. These customers are assessed on a case-by-case basis using the expert criteria of the analyst/manager, and are considered by a decision-making body (in accordance with the Credit Risk Management Policy Manual).Classification as DNPA affects all the customer's transactions Simple Default: This is the balance of transactions with amounts more than 90 days past due, unless they have been classified as written-off. Where there are stricter local criteria at certain Units, the more conservative criteria will be included for transactions in arrears.In the terminology of Bank of Spain Circular 4/04, this relates to 'Doubtful due to counterparty arrears', except that which is classified as Pre-Action Portfolio or Portfolio at Procedural Stage (see definition in this document). The sum of Simple Default and the positions in Pre-Action Portfolio and Portfolio at Procedural Stage is the total Doubtful Due to Counterparty Arrears (according to the Bank of Spain definition)Pre-Action: This category contains the positions of customers about whom there are sufficient doubts as to the possibility of repayment. This is normally the situation prior to initiating legal action.Procedural: In this situation, a court claim is made on the debt. The out-of-court process is managed with the customer by the Recovery Manager and/or through the lawyer representing us. The portfolio at procedural stage should also take into consideration customers in bankruptcy proceedings. This circumstance should not entail abandoning direct negotiations with the debtor. Therefore, the Portfolio at Procedural Stage will only include the balances of loans claimed using legal action that are not current in payment and that are non-performing. The other balances of transactions claimed using legal action that are current in payment will be included in the DNPA PortfolioWrite-offs: The balance of the customers written off or down according to the timetable (pursuant to the regulator's rules) or as a result of an internal decision where appropriate, which have been derecognised. Classification in this category does not imply that the entity will interrupt negotiations and legal actions to recover the amount owedTotal Portfolio: It will include all the transactions defined for each measure, regardless of their credit situation.",

It is defined as the balance of the debt instruments and contingent liabilities that do not meet the requirements to be classified in the following categories: substandard, doubtful due to counterparty arrears, doubtful for reasons other than counterparty arrears, or write-offs.Within this category, it will be necessary to identify the transactions that require special monitoring, which are understood to be those presenting weaknesses which, while not requiring higher coverage than those established for the standard risk transactions, make special monitoring by the entity advisable. The transactions that must be identified as under special monitoring will include, until their extinction, the following:- refinancing, refinanced or restructured transactions; - as well as those relating to customers declared to be in insolvency proceedings that have been reclassified from one of the doubtful loan categories as they met the requirements set forth therein; and- the transactions classified as standard of customers that have one or more transactions classified as doubtful due to counterparty arrears. Despite the foregoing, the refinancing, refinanced and restructured transactions will cease to be identified as under special monitoring when it has finished. This will occur after an exhaustive review of their equity and financial situation, where the holders will not foreseeably be in financial difficulty and, therefore, may meet the payment of the debt (principal and interest) of all their transactions at the entity in due time and form and, moreover, provided that they have settled the principal and interest payments accrued from the date on which the restructuring or refinancing transaction was arranged, where at least two years have elapsed since that date, where the principal of the transaction has been reduced by, at least, 20%, and where the customers have paid all the amounts (principal and interest) that were unpaid at the date of the restructuring or refinancing transaction.The Special Watch classification is a regulatory requirement and is a different concept to the Special Monitoring portfolios (see definition of FEVE contained in this document). Substandard Risk: This is a classification of customer default risk established by the Bank of Spain in its Circular 4/04. It is defined as the balance of the debt instruments and contingent liabilities that, while not meeting the criteria to be classified individually as doubtful or as write-offs, present weaknesses that may cause the entity to assume losses exceeding the coverage for impairment of the risks under special monitoring. This category includes: the transactions of customers forming part of groups in difficulties, for which overall losses are estimated that exceed those relating to the categories described in the foregoing points, and transactions not documented adequately.Furthermore, in accordance with the Corporate Policy for Debt Forbearance, the following would be classified as substandard:- Transactions classified as doubtful may be reclassified to substandard once three months of payment have elapsed (not including grace periods), provided that, during the period of the new payments of the transaction, all the amounts (principal and ordinary interest) that were unpaid at the date of forbearance are paid, and that there is reasonable certainty that the customer is able to meet the payments according to the repayment schedule.- If a grace period has been established, the forbearance will be reclassified as substandard risk, provided that it has not already been classified as doubtful risk. This classification must continue until three monthly payments (or equivalent) have been paid after the grace period has finished.- If a forbearance transaction becomes impaired, this will be regarded as sufficient cause to classify it as substandard risk:o Where, after the forbearance, a non-technical impairment situation arises, it will be classified as substandard risk, provided that this impairment denotes an overstatement of the estimated payment capacity on analysing the viability of the forbearance.o A situation may not be considered to be technically impaired where the customer continues in an impairment situation for more than 30 days or where the impaired amount is higher than a repayment amount.DNPA: DNPA meaning 'Doubtful, Not Pre-Action', is a subjective classification of the risks. In these cases, while the loan may only be in arrears or even current in payment, there are reasonable doubts as to whether the customer will make full payment of the capital and interest under the contractual terms. These customers are assessed on a case-by-case basis using the expert criteria of the analyst/manager, and are considered by a decision-making body (in accordance with the Credit Risk Management Policy Manual).Classification as DNPA affects all the customer's transactions Simple Default: This is the balance of transactions with amounts more than 90 days past due, unless they have been classified as written-off. Where there are stricter local criteria at certain Units, the more conservative criteria will be included for transactions in arrears.In the terminology of Bank of Spain Circular 4/04, this relates to 'Doubtful due to counterparty arrears', except that which is classified as Pre-Action Portfolio or Portfolio at Procedural Stage (see definition in this document). The sum of Simple Default and the positions in Pre-Action Portfolio and Portfolio at Procedural Stage is the total Doubtful Due to Counterparty Arrears (according to the Bank of Spain definition)Pre-Action: This category contains the positions of customers about whom there are sufficient doubts as to the possibility of repayment. This is normally the situation prior to initiating legal action.Procedural: In this situation, a court claim is made on the debt. The out-of-court process is managed with the customer by the Recovery Manager and/or through the lawyer representing us. The portfolio at procedural stage should also take into consideration customers in bankruptcy proceedings. This circumstance should not entail abandoning direct negotiations with the debtor. Therefore, the Portfolio at Procedural Stage will only include the balances of loans claimed using legal action that are not current in payment and that are non-performing. The other balances of transactions claimed using legal action that are current in payment will be included in the DNPA PortfolioWrite-offs: The balance of the customers written off or down according to the timetable (pursuant to the regulator's rules) or as a result of an internal decision where appropriate, which have been derecognised.
